<h1>The Best Mangas I've Read so Far</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Mangas of all time (so far).</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue</h3>
<p>
This is by far my favorite manga of all time, not only did I loved the story but because I believe that it gave me the push I needed to grow as a person. <br>
(My favorite character is Takezo!) <-- he's really cool I wanna be like him!
</p>
<h3>Vinland Saga by Makoto Yukimura</h3>
<p>
Its art, plot, comedy, and meaningful messages got me reading all the volumes from start to finish in a very short time!  <br>
(My favorite character is Hild!) <-- so strong and smart!
</p>
<h3>Chainsaw man by Tatsuki Fujimoto</h3>
<p>
Quite different from the previous two mangas but one of the coolest I've read, it made fall in love with most of the characters that were introduced (even though we don't get to see more of them). I was so excited when the anime was announced!
